## Introduction
Celo is a blockchain platform designed to enable a new universe of financial solutions accessible, including remittance systems. This tutorial's source code demonstrates how to build a basic remittance system on the Celo network using Solidity and Truffle. The remittance system consists of a smart contract that handles the transfer of funds between two parties.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the remittance system on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, you should have a solid understanding of Solidity and experience building smart contracts. Familiarity with Celo's messaging protocol and smart contract architecture is also recommended. You should also have a basic understanding of blockchain concepts and terminology.

Additionally, you will need:

- A Celo account and some testnet CELO tokens to interact with the Celo network.
- Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
- Truffle and Celo SDK installed on your computer.
- Installation

### Follow these steps to set up the project:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/celo-remittance-system.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd celo-remittance-system
- Install the required dependencies: npm install

### Usage
To compile the smart contract, run:

```bash
truffle compile
```

To deploy the smart contract to the Celo network, run:

```bash
truffle deploy --network alfajores
```
Make sure to replace "alfajores" with the appropriate network name if you're deploying to another network.

## Next 

Now that you have the remittance system set up, you can experiment with different user interfaces, such as building a mobile app or a web-based interface. You can also explore adding more features to the remittance system, such as transaction tracking, user authentication, or automatic conversion to local currencies.
